    Open two ssh sessions to the target server.

    In the first session, get the PID of bash by running:

    echo $$

    In the second session, start the authentication agent with:

    pkttyagent --process (pid from step 2)

    Back in the first session, run:

    pkexec visudo

    In the second session, you will get the password prompt. visudo will start in the first session.


(or for the most freedom pkexec --user root /bin/bash)
