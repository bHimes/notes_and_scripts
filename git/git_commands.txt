# Because I forked the cisTEM repo, I need to add a reference to the original. Using the following, we see only reference to the fork
git remote -v
# Add the repo (may switch from niko to tim at some point)
 git remote add upstream https://github.com/ngrigorieff/cisTEM.git
# confirm it is there now
git remote -v


# Fetch the current state of the upstream
 git fetch upstream

# Could merge or rebase. I'll pull in manually and commit


git remote add upstream	https://github.com/timothygrant80/cisTEM.git 


git pull --rebase upstream master

git rebase upstream/master

git push --force-with-lease origin master
